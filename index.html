      <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
      <p>
        This study is a cost-benefit analysis on clean up efforts for the Boston Harbor ecosystem. By evaluating the benefits
        of a cleaner environments, a monetary value estimate was produced to compare with the cost of the clean up projects.
        Valuation of non-market goods is one of the main challenged for this study, as economic value is a social construct. 
        The valuation methods are described and seperated by land areas as well as the estimate valuations for each area.
